## Tasks

#### useClickOutside

Search for `TODO 1` in the code, currently the dialog of choosing a pokemon will close only if you'll click a pokemon or the close button, implement `useClickOutside` and use it so any click outside of the modal will close it

#### useIsMounted

Search for `TODO 2` in the code, currently your app can encounter some exception, if you'll start a search and close it before the request is over, react will try to update an unmounted component state and fail and that will cause an exception, implement `useIsMounted` to make this exception to go away

#### useLocalStorage

Search for `TODO 3` in the code, currently after every refresh your favorite pokemomn reset to pikachu, implement `useLocalStorage` to save your choice on the local storage

#### useDebounce

Search for `TODO 4` in the code, currently on any change of the search a request is sent, implement `useDebounce` to [debounce](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/debounce-in-javascript-improve-your-applications-performance-5b01855e086) the search text in order to solve that and reduce unnecessary requests

#### Bonus

Search for `TODO 5` in the code, You'll see a console.log that indicates that one of our components re-renders a lot without a reason, fix those re-renders using the tools you got in the lecture.
